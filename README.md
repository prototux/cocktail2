# Cocktail 2
My personal terminal color scheme

This is an update to the old Cocktail color scheme, with mostly the same goals as the first Cocktail color scheme: be colorful but not flashy, but this time, with colors that goes more into pastel.

## Why yet another color scheme?

I've spent too much time looking for a dark color scheme that is not blue-ish (solarized, dracula...) or brown-ish (gruvbox, molokai...), and couldn't find what i wanted.

So, well, fuck it, let's do a custom one.
